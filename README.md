### PDXScala-2015

Programs, notes, etc, for my presentation to PDX Scala meetup in Nov 2015.

Presentation is PDXScala-2015.Rmd, with rendered output in PDXScala-2015.html.

Looks like Github renders most of the presentation, so you can just click on PDXScala-2015.Rmd to see it.
But if you want to see the equations displayed nicely (there are only a few), you could download the HTML.
